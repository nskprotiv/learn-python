<h1>Hello World</h1> 

Hello, do you want to ***code***?
***Coding*** can be tricky. I'm using coding right now, the **language** I'm using is called `Markdown`. But there are many others like `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `JSON`, `Python`, `PHP`, `SQL`, `Java`, `C++` and `C`. All of them have different uses. `C` and `C++` are used to write OSs (Operating Systems) for your computer. `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` are used to write websites. So let's make a hello world program in `Python`. First let's open a `Python IDE` like `IDLE` and write: 
````python
print("Hello World!")
````
Now run the program and you shold see:

Hello World!

The `print()` means `Python` needs to write something. The ***coder*** who made the ***program*** can edit what `Python` writes in the double quotes so instead of writing `print("Hello World!")` you could have written `print("Hello, User")` so the output would be:

Hello, User

`Python` is an easy **language** to learn but I think you can start with any **language** like I started with `HTML` which includes `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `SVG` inside it. Now it's time to say goodbye, but you can read more of my `Markdowns` which I post on **Github** with the code to help you. See you later!
